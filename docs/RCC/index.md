# Research Cloud Compute (RCC)

This section of the documentation details the known issues, limitations
and considerations around the RCC platform.

Information on the Ronin platform itself can be found in it's own
section [Ronin](../Ronin/index.md).

!!! warning

    Although RCC is currently free-at-point-of-use projects are assigned
    budgets, therefore the documentation here will explain ways in which to
    make optimal use of the services provided.
