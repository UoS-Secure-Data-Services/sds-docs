# Ronin

Ronin is the frontend user interface that connects researchers up to the AWS backed infrastructure.
It's used in both [RCC](../RCC/index.md) and [DSH](../DSH/index.md) to slightly different effect:

- Ronin in RCC makes use of [Ronin Core](https://ronin.cloud/ronin-core.html)
- Ronin in DSH makes use of [Ronin Isolate](https://ronin.cloud/ronin-isolate.html)

The subtle differences between the two allow us to provide a more locked down experience in the DSH (allowing us to hold more sensitive data)
whereas RCC allows for a simpler user access experience without compromising on overall security.
